#Guess HALs Number

I am learning Android dev skills, using Kotlin, through the Android Studio site's codelabs, and through Pluralsite.  I plan to finish studying my full stack developer skills, adding Android mobile app development skills for the front end portion of the full stack set.

This the third app I have installed on my phone. It is the first app I written almost entirely by me, as a challenge to myself to see if I am understanding what I have been learning. I did paste in a function to hide the soft keyboard when the EditText is hidden, but the rest is mine.

I chose a guess my number style game for this as a sort of tradition: ever since my science project in 5th grade, where my dad helped me write a guess my number project in basic as part of my science fair project on computers, I have made it a point to try writing a guess my number style game when learning a new language.
